# SQL Server Wait Statistics: The Complete Guide

When SQL Server encounters performance problems, wait statistics tell the story. As **Paul Randal** famously says, "waits and queues are the foundation of SQL Server performance troubleshooting." Understanding wait stats is the fastest path to identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

## What Are Wait Statistics?

Wait statistics record every time a SQL Server task must wait for a resource. When a query executes, it may wait for:

- **CPU time** (CXPACKET, SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD)
- **Disk I/O** (PAGEIOLATCH_*, WRITELOG)
- **Memory** (RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE)
- **Locks** (LCK_M_*)
- **Network** (ASYNC_NETWORK_IO)

Wait stats show WHERE SQL Server spends time waiting, which points directly to the bottleneck.

## The Top Wait Types You Need to Know

### 1. CXPACKET and CXCONSUMER - Parallelism Waits

**What it means**: Queries waiting on parallel operations to complete.

**Glenn Berry's interpretation**: Not always bad - indicates queries using parallelism. Problems occur when CXPACKET dominates your wait stats.

```sql
-- Check current parallelism settings
SELECT name, value, value_in_use
FROM sys.configurations
WHERE name IN ('cost threshold for parallelism', 'max degree of parallelism')
```

**Resolution strategies**:

1. **Increase cost threshold for parallelism** (default 5 is too low):
   ```sql
   EXEC sp_configure 'cost threshold for parallelism', 50
   RECONFIGURE
   ```

2. **Adjust MAXDOP** based on **Jonathan Kehayias's** recommendations:
   - Non-NUMA systems: MAXDOP = number of physical cores (max 8)
   - NUMA systems: MAXDOP = number of physical cores per NUMA node (max 8)

3. **Use query hints** for problem queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM LargeTable
   OPTION (MAXDOP 4)
   ```

### 2. PAGEIOLATCH_* - Disk I/O Waits

**What it means**: SQL Server waiting to read data pages from disk into memory.

**Brent Ozar's guidance**: High PAGEIOLATCH waits indicate:
- Insufficient memory (buffer pool too small)
- Slow storage subsystem
- Missing indexes causing table scans

**Diagnostic queries**:

```sql
-- Find queries causing most I/O
SELECT TOP 20
    qs.total_logical_reads + qs.total_physical_reads AS total_reads,
    qs.execution_count,
    (qs.total_logical_reads + qs.total_physical_reads) / qs.execution_count AS avg_reads,
    SUBSTRING(st.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1,
        ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(st.text)
            ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
        END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS statement_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) st
ORDER BY total_reads DESC
```

**Resolutions**:
1. Add more memory (most effective)
2. Add missing indexes
3. Improve storage performance (faster disks, RAID configuration)
4. Implement data compression

### 3. WRITELOG - Transaction Log Waits

**What it means**: Waiting for transaction log writes to complete.

**Paul Randal's** critical advice: WRITELOG waits directly impact transaction commit time. This affects INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and commit operations.

**Common causes**:
- Slow log disk (biggest culprit)
- Too-frequent commits in loops
- Large transactions
- Auto-growth events

**Erik Darling's optimization steps**:

```sql
-- Check log file configuration
SELECT 
    DB_NAME(database_id) AS DatabaseName,
    name AS LogicalName,
    physical_name AS PhysicalLocation,
    size * 8 / 1024 AS SizeMB,
    growth,
    is_percent_growth
FROM sys.master_files
WHERE type_desc = 'LOG'
```

**Best practices**:
1. **Separate log files** to dedicated fast storage (SSD/NVMe)
2. **Pre-size log files** to avoid auto-growth during busy periods
3. **Set fixed growth** (not percentage) - e.g., 512MB increments
4. **Batch operations** when possible:

```sql
-- Bad: Individual commits in loop
WHILE @Counter < @MaxRows
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO TargetTable VALUES (...)
    SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
END

-- Good: Batch operations
INSERT INTO TargetTable
SELECT * FROM SourceTable
WHERE ProcessedFlag = 0
```

### 4. LCK_M_* - Lock Waits

**What it means**: Queries waiting to acquire locks on resources.

**Kendra Little's** rule: Blocking is the #1 cause of user complaints about "slow database."

**Types of lock waits**:
- `LCK_M_S`: Shared lock waits (SELECT statements)
- `LCK_M_U`: Update lock waits
- `LCK_M_X`: Exclusive lock waits (UPDATE, DELETE)

**Finding blockers with Adam Machanic's sp_WhoIsActive**:

```sql
EXEC sp_WhoIsActive 
    @get_locks = 1,
    @get_plans = 1,
    @get_task_info = 2
```

**Prevention strategies**:

1. **Minimize transaction scope**:
   ```sql
   -- Bad
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   SELECT * FROM LargeTable  -- Long read
   UPDATE SmallTable SET ...
   COMMIT
   
   -- Good
   SELECT * FROM LargeTable  -- Outside transaction
   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   UPDATE SmallTable SET ... -- Only update in transaction
   COMMIT
   ```

2. **Use READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT** (Grant Fritchey's recommendation):
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE YourDB
   SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON
   ```

3. **Add covering indexes** to reduce lock duration
4. **Consider lock hints** carefully (WITH (NOLOCK) has risks!)

### 5. ASYNC_NETWORK_IO - Client Not Reading Data

**What it means**: SQL Server has results ready, but the client application isn't retrieving them.

**Brent Ozar's diagnosis**: This is almost always an APPLICATION problem, not a database problem.

**Common causes**:
- Application processing rows one-by-one
- Network issues
- Client-side formatting/calculations
- Reporting tools fetching unnecessary columns

**Solutions**:
1. Review application code - batch fetching
2. Return only needed columns (avoid SELECT *)
3. Use pagination for large result sets
4. Check network connectivity

## Automated Wait Stats Monitoring

Manual wait stats analysis is critical during troubleshooting, but continuous monitoring is essential for production systems. This is where modern automation frameworks excel.

## Glenn Berry's Diagnostic Queries for Wait Stats

**Glenn Berry**, known for his comprehensive diagnostic queries, provides this essential wait stats query:

```sql
WITH Waits AS
(
    SELECT 
        wait_type,
        wait_time_ms / 1000.0 AS WaitSeconds,
        (wait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms) / 1000.0 AS ResourceSeconds,
        signal_wait_time_ms / 1000.0 AS SignalSeconds,
        waiting_tasks_count AS WaitCount,
        100.0 * wait_time_ms / SUM(wait_time_ms) OVER() AS Percentage
    FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats
    WHERE wait_type NOT IN (
        'CLR_SEMAPHORE', 'LAZYWRITER_SLEEP', 'RESOURCE_QUEUE',
        'SLEEP_TASK', 'SLEEP_SYSTEMTASK', 'SQLTRACE_BUFFER_FLUSH',
        'WAITFOR', 'LOGMGR_QUEUE', 'CHECKPOINT_QUEUE',
        'REQUEST_FOR_DEADLOCK_SEARCH', 'XE_TIMER_EVENT', 'BROKER_TO_FLUSH',
        'BROKER_TASK_STOP', 'CLR_MANUAL_EVENT', 'CLR_AUTO_EVENT',
        'DISPATCHER_QUEUE_SEMAPHORE', 'FT_IFTS_SCHEDULER_IDLE_WAIT',
        'XE_DISPATCHER_WAIT', 'XE_DISPATCHER_JOIN', 'SQLTRACE_INCREMENTAL_FLUSH_SLEEP'
    )
)
SELECT
    W1.wait_type AS WaitType,
    CAST(W1.WaitSeconds AS DECIMAL(12, 2)) AS WaitSeconds,
    CAST(W1.ResourceSeconds AS DECIMAL(12, 2)) AS ResourceSeconds,
    CAST(W1.SignalSeconds AS DECIMAL(12, 2)) AS SignalSeconds,
    W1.WaitCount,
    CAST(W1.Percentage AS DECIMAL(4, 2)) AS Percentage
FROM Waits W1
WHERE W1.Percentage > 0.01
ORDER BY W1.Percentage DESC
```

## Wait Stats Best Practices

Drawing from the SQL Server community's collective wisdom:

1. **Clear wait stats after major changes** (Paul Randal):
   ```sql
   DBCC SQLPERF('sys.dm_os_wait_stats', CLEAR)
   ```

2. **Focus on the top 5-10 waits** (Brent Ozar): Don't try to eliminate all waits

3. **Consider wait context** (Jonathan Kehayias): High waits on an idle server are normal

4. **Combine with other metrics** (Glenn Berry): Wait stats + perfmon + extended events

5. **Monitor trends** (Kendra Little): Sudden changes matter more than absolute values

6. **Automate collection** (Ola Hallengren): Manual checks miss intermittent issues

## Common Wait Stats Patterns

### OLTP Workloads
**Normal**: LCK_M_*, CXPACKET (low %), WRITELOG
**Problematic**: PAGEIOLATCH_*, RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD

### Data Warehouse/Reporting
**Normal**: CXPACKET/CXCONSUMER (high %), PAGEIOLATCH_SH
**Problematic**: RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, LCK_M_*, WRITELOG

### Mixed Workloads
**Normal**: Balanced mix of reads and writes
**Problematic**: Any single wait type dominating (&gt;40%)
