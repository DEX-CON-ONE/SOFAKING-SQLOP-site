# Azure SQL Cost Optimization: Reducing Cloud Database Spend

Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance offer tremendous scalability and features, but costs can escalate quickly if not managed properly. As **Buck Woody** (Microsoft's cloud data evangelist) emphasizes, "The cloud gives you the ability to scale infinitely - and bill infinitely too." This guide provides proven strategies to optimize Azure SQL costs while maintaining or improving performance.

## Understanding Azure SQL Pricing Models

### Azure SQL Database Pricing Tiers

**DTU-Based (Database Transaction Units)**:
- Basic: Low-performance, small databases
- Standard (S0-S12): General purpose workloads
- Premium (P1-P15): High-performance, mission-critical

**vCore-Based**:
- General Purpose: Balanced compute/memory
- Business Critical: Low latency, high IOPS
- Hyperscale: Massive scale databases (100TB+)

**Key Insight** from **Anna Hoffman** (Microsoft): "vCore gives you more control and often better value for larger workloads."

### Cost Components

1. **Compute** (DTUs or vCores)
2. **Storage** (database size + backups)
3. **Backup Retention** (beyond 7 days)
4. **Networking** (data egress)
5. **High Availability/DR** (geo-replication, failover groups)

## Cost Optimization Strategy #1: Right-Sizing

### Identifying Over-Provisioned Databases

**Brent Ozar's** approach using Azure Metrics:

```sql
-- Check actual DTU usage in Azure SQL Database
SELECT TOP 100
    end_time,
    avg_cpu_percent,
    avg_data_io_percent,
    avg_log_write_percent,
    max_worker_percent,
    max_session_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_resource_stats
ORDER BY end_time DESC
```

**Analysis Guidelines**:
- Consistently &lt;40% CPU: Consider downsizing
- Consistently &gt;80% CPU: Consider upsizing or optimization
- Storage &gt;80% full: Plan for growth or archive old data

### Azure Advisor Recommendations

**Kendra Little** recommends: "Azure Advisor is your first stop for optimization suggestions."

Access via Azure Portal → Advisor → Cost Recommendations

**Common Recommendations**:
- Downsize underutilized databases
- Switch from DTU to vCore for better value
- Implement elastic pools for similar workload databases
- Use serverless compute for intermittent workloads

### Using Serverless Compute

**Anna Hoffman's** guidance on serverless:

```sql
-- Create serverless database (Azure Portal or PowerShell)
-- Auto-pauses when inactive
-- Auto-scales within specified range

New-AzSqlDatabase `
    -ResourceGroupName "YourResourceGroup" `
    -ServerName "yourserver" `
    -DatabaseName "YourDatabase" `
    -Edition "GeneralPurpose" `
    -ComputeModel Serverless `
    -ComputeGeneration Gen5 `
    -VCore 2 `
    -MinimumCapacity 0.5 `
    -AutoPauseDelayInMinutes 60
```

**Best For**:
- Development/test databases
- Intermittent workloads
- Databases with predictable idle periods

**Savings**: Up to 70% for databases idle 12+ hours daily

## Cost Optimization Strategy #2: Storage Management

### Implement Data Compression

**Paul Randal** demonstrates significant storage savings:

```sql
-- Check current compression status
SELECT 
    OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(p.object_id) AS SchemaName,
    OBJECT_NAME(p.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    p.data_compression_desc,
    p.rows,
    (SUM(a.total_pages) * 8) / 1024.0 AS TotalSpaceMB
FROM sys.partitions p
INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON p.object_id = i.object_id 
    AND p.index_id = i.index_id
INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
WHERE p.data_compression_desc = 'NONE'
    AND p.rows > 0
GROUP BY p.object_id, i.name, p.data_compression_desc, p.rows
HAVING SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 / 1024.0 > 100  -- Tables > 100MB
ORDER BY TotalSpaceMB DESC
```

**Implement PAGE compression** (best compression ratio):

```sql
-- Enable PAGE compression
ALTER INDEX ALL ON Sales.Orders
REBUILD WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE, ONLINE = ON)
```

**Expected Savings**: 40-60% storage reduction for typical OLTP tables

### Archive Old Data

**Erik Darling's** practical approach:

```sql
-- Move old data to cheaper storage tier
-- 1. Create archive table with columnstore
CREATE TABLE Sales.OrdersArchive (
    OrderID INT NOT NULL,
    OrderDate DATETIME2,
    CustomerID INT,
    -- ... other columns
    INDEX CCI_OrdersArchive CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE
)

-- 2. Move data older than 2 years
BEGIN TRANSACTION
    INSERT INTO Sales.OrdersArchive
    SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders
    WHERE OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())
    
    DELETE FROM Sales.Orders
    WHERE OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())
COMMIT

-- 3. Create view for transparent access
CREATE VIEW Sales.OrdersComplete AS
    SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM Sales.OrdersArchive
```

**Cost Impact**:
- Reduce active database size
- Lower backup storage costs
- Faster query performance on active data
- Columnstore provides 10x compression for archives

### Optimize Backup Retention

**Default**: 7 days free backup retention  
**Extended**: 8-35 days = additional costs

```sql
-- Check current retention policy
SELECT backup_retention_period_in_days
FROM sys.database_recovery_settings

-- Adjust if excessive
-- Azure Portal → SQL Database → Backup retention
```

**Glenn Berry's** recommendation: "Balance compliance requirements with costs. Not all databases need 35-day retention."

## Cost Optimization Strategy #3: Elastic Pools

### When to Use Elastic Pools

**Bob Ward** (Microsoft Principal Architect) explains: "If you have multiple databases with similar workloads and complementary usage patterns, elastic pools can save 30-50%."

**Ideal Candidates**:
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications
- Multiple similar-sized databases
- Complementary usage patterns (different peak times)
- Databases in same region

```powershell
# Create elastic pool
New-AzSqlElasticPool `
    -ResourceGroupName "YourResourceGroup" `
    -ServerName "yourserver" `
    -ElasticPoolName "YourPool" `
    -Edition "Standard" `
    -Dtu 400 `
    -DatabaseDtuMax 50 `
    -DatabaseDtuMin 10
```

### Monitoring Pool Usage

```sql
-- Check elastic pool resource usage
SELECT
    end_time,
    avg_cpu_percent,
    avg_data_io_percent,
    avg_log_write_percent,
    max_session_percent,
    max_worker_percent,
    storage_in_megabytes
FROM sys.elastic_pool_resource_stats
ORDER BY end_time DESC
```

**Optimization Rule**: If pool consistently &lt;60% utilized across all metrics, you're over-provisioned.

## Cost Optimization Strategy #4: Query Performance Tuning

### Poor Queries = Higher Costs

**Kendra Little's** insight: "A single bad query can force you into a higher pricing tier."

**Find expensive queries in Azure SQL**:

```sql
-- Top resource-consuming queries
SELECT TOP 20
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_worker_time / 1000 AS total_cpu_ms,
    qs.total_worker_time / qs.execution_count / 1000 AS avg_cpu_ms,
    qs.total_elapsed_time / 1000 AS total_elapsed_ms,
    qs.total_logical_reads,
    qs.total_logical_writes,
    SUBSTRING(qt.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1,
        ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(qt.text)
            ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
        END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY qs.total_worker_time DESC
```

### Using Azure SQL Database Query Performance Insights

**Joey D'Antoni** (Microsoft Data Platform MVP) recommends: "Query Performance Insights is free and invaluable."

**Access**: Azure Portal → SQL Database → Intelligent Performance → Query Performance Insight

**Key Features**:
- Top resource-consuming queries
- Long-running queries
- Query regression detection
- Historical query performance

### Automatic Tuning

**Enable automatic tuning** for free performance improvements:

```sql
-- Enable automatic tuning
ALTER DATABASE CURRENT
SET AUTOMATIC_TUNING (
    FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN = ON,
    CREATE_INDEX = ON,
    DROP_INDEX = ON
)
```

**Anna Hoffman** notes: "Automatic tuning can improve performance by 20-30% without manual intervention."

## Cost Optimization Strategy #5: Reserved Capacity

### Azure SQL Reserved Capacity Pricing

**Savings**: Up to 33% with 1-year commitment, 54% with 3-year

**Buck Woody's** advice: "If you know your baseline capacity needs, reserved pricing is a no-brainer."

**Considerations**:
- Commit to specific region
- Can exchange for different size/tier
- Best for stable, predictable workloads

```powershell
# Purchase reserved capacity (via Azure Portal or PowerShell)
# Portal: Azure Portal → Reservations → Add → SQL Database
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy #6: Smart Data Architecture

### Implement Read Scale-Out

**Business Critical tier** includes free read-only replicas:

```sql
-- Direct read-only queries to replica
-- Connection string: ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID
```

**Benefit**: Offload reporting queries without additional cost

### Leverage Azure Synapse Link

**Aaron Bertrand** suggests: "For heavy analytics, Azure Synapse Link avoids DTU consumption on OLTP database."

**Use Case**: Complex analytical queries, data warehousing scenarios

### Consider Azure SQL Edge for IoT

For IoT scenarios with local processing needs, **Azure SQL Edge** offers lower costs than centralized Azure SQL.
