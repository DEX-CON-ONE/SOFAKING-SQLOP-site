## Link Categorization Review

### Navigation is Sensibly Organized:

- ✅ All Services (overview)
- ✅ Solutions (problem-first approach)
- Both are service-related and make sense together

**Learn Dropdown:**
- ✅ Blog (educational content)
- ✅ Products (aDBA automation tool)
- ✅ Resources (additional learning materials)
- All are educational/informational resources

**Top Level:**
- ✅ Home, Pricing, About, Contact
- These are standard top-level navigation items

### Footer is Properly Categorized:

**Services:** Actionable items users want to purchase
- All Services, Performance Tuning, Health Check, Query Optimization, Solutions

**Company:** About the business
- About Us, Case Studies, Pricing

**Support:** Help and assistance
- FAQ, Contact, Privacy Policy

**Learn:** Educational resources
- Blog, Products, Resources

## Notes

1. **Solutions Form Integration:** The contact form is production-ready. It gracefully handles the case where HubSpot credentials are not yet provided by logging to console and still redirecting to booking.

2. **Mobile Navigation:** Blog, Products, and Resources are now properly indented under their respective categories in mobile view.

3. **All Pages Verified:** Every page route has been confirmed to exist and render correctly.

4. **No Loose Ends:** All functionality works. Only missing items are API keys that need to be provided by the client.

## Ready for Production ✅

The site is ready to deploy to production with the following caveats:
1. HubSpot integration will activate once credentials are provided
2. Privacy Policy page exists but may need content review
3. Standard pre-launch checklist items recommended but not blocking

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** (pending HubSpot keys for full lead tracking)
